HEX VIRUS (aka Filler)
by Alice Gurkova

This is a variation of the famous Filler (7 Colours) game (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Colors).

The objective of the game is to capture the most hexes on the game board.
The player expands their colony by choosing a new colour for it in each turn.
The colony is repainted in that colour and all adjacent hexes of the same colour join the colony.
Also any of the hexes that are surrounded by the player's colony join the colony.

The game ends when there are no more unclaimed hexes left on the board.

A player's score is the number of hexes in their colony.

The player with the highest score wins the game.

Technical notes:
1. Game class contains the main() method that by default launches the game with Graphical User Interface.
2. The Game can be launched with a Text User Interface by commenting out line 22 and uncommenting line 23 in Game.java before launching.
